What is a location?

a latitude (dist north/south of equator) - north is positive
a longitude (dist east/west of Greenwich) - east is positive

These can be written in old school e.g latitude might be: 47Â° 38' 34" N, 

but we will be using the decimal forms 



How the browser gets your location

whether each of these are used depends on if your device supports them/has them enabled

GPS - e.g on a mobile device. GPS can also include altitude and heading info
IP address-  uses database of known IP addresses to physical location. - not perfect but can still be applicable
Wifi - uses database of known wifi access points and calculates your distance from it - also not perfect
Cell Phone triangulation - measure distance and signal strength from one or more cell phone towers


typically you won't know which method your browser is using, and you don't need to - but you can ask browser for a measure of accuracy


geolocation is supported on ie 9+, all good browsers incl. mobile


getCurrentPosition has three typical error responses: 
1. Permission Denied (by user)
2. Position Unavailable
3. Timeout

the numbers correspond to the error.code properties
