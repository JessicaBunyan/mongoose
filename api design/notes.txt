API Design using Node/Express/Mongo

REST - representational state transfer

REST is a not a framework, or a standard, its more of a paradigm
The modern web is largely built around REST

it should be stateless - it should perform 1 action thats fresh and doesn't depend on previous or future requests
it should use HTTP verbs explicitly
it should expose a directory-like URL pattern for the routes
it should transfer JSON or XML (lets be honest its JSON nowadays)

Rest principles match the verbs to CRUD actions as follows

GET -> READ
POST -> CREATE
PUT -> UPDATE
DELETE -> DESTROY / DELETE


HTTP 201 - successfully created
